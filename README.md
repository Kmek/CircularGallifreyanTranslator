# Circular Gallifreyan Translator
A project from high school that translates text into the fictional written language [Circular Gallifreyan](http://timeturners.wikidot.com/circular-gallifreyan) from Doctor Who.

## Website
The translator is viewable [here](https://kmek.github.io/CircularGallifreyanTranslator/) through GitHub Pages.

## Notes
This translator is best used as a layout for drawing more intricate and interconnected designs. 
While it does vary symbol size and placement to some degree, this translator is not intended to make complete Circular Gallifreyan drawings.
Also, as a personal choice, vowels are drawn at the same level as consonants, rather than being attached to the previous consonant (as seen in most fan drawings).

### Noted issue 
- Input: hello there
- Observed output: two circles are drawn overlapping each other on the center
- Desired output: two separate circles
- Idea: the "th" being replaced is somehow messing something up, because this doesn't happen with a word not starting with a combo character
